Before I decided to\n                    learn web development, I dreamt of being a rock star. Following a short stint playing local clubs\n                    after high school, I enrolled in ACC's music program, eventually earning an Associate of Arts\n                    degree. Shortly thereafter, I decided to become a nurse, and graduated from UT Austin with a\n                    Bachelor's degree in 2010. However, I still longed for more knowledge, and eventually graduated from\n                    Texas Wesleyan University in 2015, earning a Master's degree in nurse anesthesia.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n    \n            <div>\n                <p className=\"bio-text\">After four years of enjoying the fruits of my many years of labor, life was turned\n                    upside down by a worldwide pandemic. I looked for a silver lining, and realized that the enormous\n                    amount of time I now spent at home had presented the perfect opportunity to learn a new skill that's\n                    always fascinated me--coding! The rest has yet to occur, and so far my current adventure has proven\n                    every bit as challenging and rewarding as I'd hoped.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    \n    </section>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default About;","/Users/jwj/Desktop/Desktop-Folders/projects/react-portfolio/src/components/Nav/index.js",["39","40","41"],"/Users/jwj/Desktop/Desktop-Folders/projects/react-portfolio/src/components/Contact/index.js",[],"/Users/jwj/Desktop/Desktop-Folders/projects/react-portfolio/src/utils/helpers.js",[],"/Users/jwj/Desktop/Desktop-Folders/projects/react-portfolio/src/components/Work/index.js",[],{"ruleId":"42","replacedBy":"43"},{"ruleId":"44","replacedBy":"45"},{"ruleId":"46","severity":1,"message":"47","line":2,"column":8,"nodeType":"48","messageId":"49","endLine":2,"endColumn":19},{"ruleId":"46","severity":1,"message":"50","line":1,"column":17,"nodeType":"48","messageId":"49","endLine":1,"endColumn":26},{"ruleId":"46","severity":1,"message":"51","line":6,"column":9,"nodeType":"48","messageId":"49","endLine":6,"endColumn":21},{"ruleId":"46","severity":1,"message":"52","line":7,"column":9,"nodeType":"48","messageId":"49","endLine":7,"endColumn":24},"no-native-reassign",["53"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["54"],"no-unused-vars","'headerImage' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","'useEffect' is defined but never used.","'workSelected' is assigned a value but never used.","'setWorkSelected' is assigned a value but never used.","no-global-assign","no-unsafe-negation"]
