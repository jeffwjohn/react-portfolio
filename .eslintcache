Before I decided to\n                    learn web development, I dreamt of being a rock star. Following a short stint playing local clubs\n                    after high school, I enrolled in ACC's music program, eventually earning an Associate of Arts\n                    degree. Shortly thereafter, I decided to become a nurse, and graduated from UT Austin with a\n                    Bachelor's degree in 2010. However, I still longed for more knowledge, and eventually graduated from\n                    Texas Wesleyan University in 2015, earning a Master's degree in nurse anesthesia.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n    \n            <div>\n                <p className=\"bio-text\">After four years of enjoying the fruits of my many years of labor, life was turned\n                    upside down by a worldwide pandemic. I looked for a silver lining, and realized that the enormous\n                    amount of time I now spent at home had presented the perfect opportunity to learn a new skill that's\n                    always fascinated me--coding! The rest has yet to occur, and so far my current adventure has proven\n                    every bit as challenging and rewarding as I'd hoped.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    \n    </section>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default About;","/Users/jwj/Desktop/Desktop-Folders/projects/react-portfolio/src/components/Nav/index.js",[],"/Users/jwj/Desktop/Desktop-Folders/projects/react-portfolio/src/components/Contact/index.js",[],"/Users/jwj/Desktop/Desktop-Folders/projects/react-portfolio/src/utils/helpers.js",[],["36","37"],{"ruleId":"38","replacedBy":"39"},{"ruleId":"40","replacedBy":"41"},{"ruleId":"42","severity":1,"message":"43","line":2,"column":8,"nodeType":"44","messageId":"45","endLine":2,"endColumn":19},{"ruleId":"38","replacedBy":"46"},{"ruleId":"40","replacedBy":"47"},"no-native-reassign",["48"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["49"],"no-unused-vars","'headerImage' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar",["48"],["49"],"no-global-assign","no-unsafe-negation"]
